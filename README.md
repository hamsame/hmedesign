# This is a website for a fake interior design company. 
I built the website with HTML,SCSS which I recently learned and some JavaScript.

I added the google maps and a map marker to pinpoint an address and created a lightbox using JavaScript which enlarges an image that's been clicked on from the showcase (first) section.
